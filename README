	------------------------------------------------------------------------------	
	ITTERATIVE SOFT THRESHOLDING(IST) FOR SPARSE NUCLEAR MAGNETIC RESONANCE(NMR):
	------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	Requirements:
	Linux
	c-(gcc)
	swig
	FFTW3 (lfftw3)
	Python2.7 or Relative version

	Optimized for a single core

	To Make:

	make CFLAGS="-I {$USERNAME}/path/to/python*.*"

	To Use:

	IN/OUT File format per line
	x,y,I

	Note*- In the in file we take the sparse file of a nx*ny(Ignoring Sigma) NMR Data in a 2nx*2ny grid in the time domain(This data will be sparse in the Time 		Domain Not Frequency Domain). This will generate the output file in the original nx*ny domain.

		To Run:
		
		$python main.py

		We set the IN/OUT files.

		In the GUI for dimensions we insert the original nx*ny dimensions

		For the best performance iterations should be > 200 and 0.6 > thereshold < 0.9 (Comparing to 128*128 grid)

		Click calculate.
		
		Data will be written in output file and spectra contours shown
            

	To Test:
       		Use sample_sparse_NMR.txt(sparsified version of sample_NMR.txt in **time domain**) as input file and output file istout.txt
